Why bug then size too big ?

Impoze palette for ply : RRGGGBBB

use long for sizes

Use SDL + OpenGL to simplify compilation

use in osmose

add a "background" class, containing a big voximage compressed with RLE. Choose which part to show

make a Scene constructor that copies size of "reference" voximg

For ply, ask for one size. Compute the other with actual ply size.



------------------------------------- game:

add a fixed hitbox for perso.
why is snowball black in 24bpv mode ?
maybe use 4th byte (unused) for nature of voxel (snow, for sub...). or for alpha ? (snow flake)
